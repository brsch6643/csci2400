This is bomb 13 for lab ColoradoSummer2013.

It is owned by the following student(s):

Phase1: There was an address with a string that was being compared to the input string. 
Those needed to be the same.

Phase2:  There were six numbers that needed to be in a specific pattern.

Phase3: This required two numbers and I don't remember what for.

Phase4:  There was a factorial function and stored number.  You need to figure out what number was need so that
the factorial of that number was equal to the stored number.

Phase5:  This took in a string and had a stored string.  It used ascii binary references to letters to produce a certain string that it was looking for.

Phase6:  This was a linked list.  Each node contained a hex value.  
The nodes had to be in a certain order so that the hex value was in descending order.  
Each input integer referenced a specific node so you had to put them in the right order so the nodes were in order.  
Find the nodes and test the inputs to see the pattern.
